Name: Practicing DOM by Moving Pacman across the screen

Description:    In this project I used the DOM to move multiple images of Pacman across the screen.
		By creating an object and having it flip between multiple images I was able to simulate
		Pacman opening and closing its' mouth, as well as face the correct direction.
		To do this I created a function which moves the image and checks for the bounds of the window.
		If the image gets too close to the bounds, the image will flip and move the opposite direction.

Usage:          While this project has no applicable usage I can think of. It serves as a good first step for me
		to understand the DOM and how objects created in HTML can be manipulated via Javascript.
