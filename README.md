# Pacman

This project allows the user to add pacman images to the screen and then let them bounce around randomly.

To run the project, download all of the files to the same directory and run the index.html in your favorite browswer.
From there click 'Add PacMan' to add a new PacMan to the screen
Click 'Start Game' to move all the PacMen around the screen

In the future I will add the following:
  ability for PacMan to look vertically
  bugfix where PacMan will turn around too soon
